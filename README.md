# NeoVim Configuration

## Summary

NeoVim is a powerful tool that users can use different hot-keys to be able to edit text files without the need of the mouse to make a more emersive experience when writting.
One of the best use cases of editting these files is by using NeoVim as an IDE for programming.
One of the hardest things to do for getting started in Vim is losing all of the special abillities of diffferent IDE's like VSCode.
The purpose of this project is to link all of the tools I need while coding and developing full stack applications.

## Overview

In this repository, I use Lua as a way to maintain and attach all of the packages to be attached to the NeoVim space.
A tutorial for getting started linking Lua to Neovim can be found here:

Once the Lua environment has been setup, I use Packer to manage my different packages. You can find more information by looking at the repository here:
